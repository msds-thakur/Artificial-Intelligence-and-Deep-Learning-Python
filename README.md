# Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning
An introduction to the field of artificial intelligence, this course illustrates probability-rule-based
generative models as well as discriminative models that learn from training data. The course 
reviews applications of artificial intelligence and deep learning in vision and language
processing. Students learn best practices for building supervised learning models and, in
particular, deep neural networks for classification and regression. Students also learn about
feature engineering, autoencoders, and strategies of unsupervised and semi-supervised
learning, as well as reinforcement learning.
